<b>Aloha</b> is a mobile home automation application to trigger actions on your Philips Hue lights when your device connects or disconnects from your wifi network.
This is a work in progress, with updates to come.

# Getting Started
Before development, make sure that your phillips hue lights and bridge are functioning properly and that you're on the same wifi network.

### Pre-Requisites
Aloha is developed using the angular flavor of nativescript. Using npm, install Nativescript 
```bash
npm i -g nativescript
```
- set up nativescript https://docs.nativescript.org/start/introduction
- set up emulator -> so far only tested on android.

# Usage
Run on android using 
```bash
tns run android
```
Run on iOS with
```bash
tns run ios
```
Note: This project has never been built for iOS, so no guarantee everything will work smoothly.
